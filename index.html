				<p> MTI Corp Field Services Mobile App.
					This is a design for the MTI Field Technicians use MTI techs are dispatched to large retailers for 
					installation of floor demonstration products such as 
					flat screen televisions sound hardware and or many other products. 
					The field techs needed a replacement for the Salesforce mobile app as MTI had decided to not renew the Salesforce contract. 
					This app was developed to replace it. </p>

			<h2> "FaceMod Mobile App </h2>
			<p> FaceMod mobile app is a design that was developed to allow for the application of FX makeup. 
				This was a design that was created out of user frustrations with current offerings, 
				such as Youtube. The main areas that the mobile app addressed were being able to see what your face would
				 look like prior to applying make up. This is done through an AR Camera component. 
				Secondly detailed instructions were heavily requested during user research.</p>

			<h2> "Find Friends For Mobile App </h2>
			<p> The Find Friends For Mobile app is an app that I developed. The Mobile app Find Friends For is the complete platform for meeting new people and making friends through small group activities! The app allows for the creation, publishing, and joining of activities for small groups of people. In our research we have found that making new friends for adults is difficult. Our app allows for people to be able to meet for a nice game and then form bonds that lead to friendships from those shared experiences. </p>
