		<p>I currently reside in the Palm Springs area of So Cal as it is often referred to. I have my 2 puppies that I love taking for desert hicks as well as golfing as often as I can. I have been a fitness fanatic for many years and still follow an active lifestyle.

			Having lived in the Los Angeles area for many years I have been attached to many scenes over the years. I started out as a video editor when computers were just entering into the process. I have used Apple hardware most of my career and continue to do so. I spent 15+ years at Apple Inc. when Final Cut Pro was not even version 1.0. I was able to use my skills as an editor to help elevate the Apple product line into many editorial houses. Over the course of my career I have worked with many solutions and have developed a knack for good design. 
			
			User centered design is one of my passions as I get frustrated when I am forced to do something that I know could have been done a better way. 
			
			I am a User Experience Specialist meaning that I have an understanding of both the design needed to engage users as well as an understanding of what all is required in order to achieve that. Having traveled the world during my military service I have been exposed to many cultural differences and feel that embracing those makes us understand others much more easily. Keeping empathy for users is and always will be a passion of mine.
